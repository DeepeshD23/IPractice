Chat App Using Socket.IO
Overview
This project is a basic real-time chat application built using HTML, Socket.IO, Node.js, and Express.js. The app allows users to send and receive messages in real-time using WebSockets.

Features
Real-time two-way communication using WebSockets.
Simple UI to send and display messages.
Automatic broadcasting of messages to all connected users.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v14+ recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository or copy the code files.

Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install express socket.io
Create the following directory structure:

java
Copy code
project-folder/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── server.js
└── package.json
Place the provided HTML code in public/index.html.
Place the Node.js server code in server.js.
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Open a browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:9000
Code Details
Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)
index.html:

A simple UI with:
An input field to type messages.
Buttons to send messages and create a WebSocket connection.
A container to display chat messages.
The frontend script initializes a Socket.IO connection and sends/receives messages.
Key Functions:

createConnection(): Establishes a WebSocket connection with the server.
Listens to incoming messages via the message event and displays them in the chat.
Backend (Node.js + Socket.IO)
server.js:
Uses Express to serve static files and the chat UI.
Initializes a Socket.IO server for real-time communication.
Handles:
User messages sent via the user-message event.
Broadcasting messages to all connected clients via the message event.
How It Works
User Interaction:

User opens the chat app in the browser.
User clicks "Create WS Connection" to establish a connection with the WebSocket server.
User types a message and clicks "Send".
Message Flow:

The message is emitted to the server via socket.emit('user-message').
The server broadcasts the message to all connected clients via io.emit('message').
Display Messages:

The frontend listens for incoming message events and dynamically updates the chat display.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML, CSS (basic styling can be added), JavaScript.
Socket.IO Client Library.
Backend:

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
Express.js: Lightweight web framework for serving files.
Socket.IO: Enables real-time, bi-directional communication.
Usage Example
Run the server:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Open the app in multiple browser tabs.
Type a message in one tab and see it broadcast to all connected tabs.
Future Improvements
Add user identification (e.g., usernames).
Implement private messaging between users.
Enhance the UI with CSS for better usability.
Add message timestamps and a chat history.
